# Hungriness-and-Satisfaction

## Idea and motivation
Ever since i was little i was fascinated buy games, and wanted to create one. This course was one of the first steps towards achieving that goal. Since learing programing is all about being in your discomfort zone and challening your self i wanted to learn a new library for this final project.
Library that at the end i choose to learn was "Rich". The idea was to create a fun little game in Terminal and since Rich library is all about making terminal prettier and having more easier control over it, naturally it drew me in. 

## Point of the game
Main point of the game is to go around municipalities(opstine) in Belgrade and satisfy needs of your character by buying food
