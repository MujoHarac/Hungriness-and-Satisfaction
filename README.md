# Hungriness-and-Satisfaction

## Idea and motivation
Ever since i was little i was fascinated by games, and wanted to create one. This course CS50P was one of the first steps towards achieving that goal. Since learing programing is all about being in your discomfort zone and challenging yourself i wanted to learn a new library for this final project.
Library that at the end i choose to learn was "Rich". The idea was to create a fun little game in Terminal and since Rich library is all about making terminal prettier and having more easier control over it, naturally it drew me in. 

## Point of the game
Main point of the game is to go around municipalities in Belgrade and satisfy needs of your character by buying food. By "satisfying needs" i mean, you have two bars; Hungerless and Irritation, depending on your character preference diffrent multiplier applies on the foods you buy which updates your two bars accordingly.
Hungerless bar fills when you buy food but Irritation bar fills when you travel for said food, soo one has to take that in to consideration and depending on the weather for that day some characters could be easily irritated.
